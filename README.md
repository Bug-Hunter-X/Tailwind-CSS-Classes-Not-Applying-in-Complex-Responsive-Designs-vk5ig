# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in Complex Responsive Designs

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS in a complex responsive design.  Specifically, certain Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to specific components, even though the syntax appears correct. This is likely due to unexpected CSS specificity conflicts or incorrect application of responsive modifiers. 

## Bug Description

The bug manifests as missing styles in components despite correctly using Tailwind classes. The issue is particularly pronounced when the responsive design utilizes multiple modifiers, nested components, or complex state management. The bug isn't easily reproducible in simplified examples, hinting at a subtle interaction between different CSS rules.

## Bug Solution

The provided solution applies more specific selectors and modifies the CSS order to ensure the desired styles are applied effectively. This may involve adjusting the order of stylesheets or using `!important` flags (though these should be used sparingly), potentially requiring deeper investigation of CSS specificity using browser developer tools.
